# Scope
Support GCSE students with their Science revision with a simple Q&A style chat bot.

## Core functionality
Provide GCSE-level answers to Science revision questions. 

Based on the question the user asks, the chatbox forms an answer with relevant information based on the topic of the question.

## Requirements
The chat bot shall:

1) reliabily interpret user intent related to science revision questions
   1) e.g: Science topic question
```
Given the student asks a question about plant leaf anatomy

When the chatbot platform identifies the correct entities: ['topic', 'biology', 'leaf']

Then the chat bot shall respond: '...'

    n.b this could also be a table of expected responses.
```
